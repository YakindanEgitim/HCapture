HCapture
========

A proof of concept change data capture tool for Hbase environment. 

## Aim
Main aim of this tool is to capture nosql transactions from Hbase edit logs and reflect these changes to another nosql
database or any RDMS with adapters.

Change data capture tools are widely used in relational database systems for disaster recovery, reporting and triggering 
external system without effecting production system. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)
